# Jquery Image Carousel Plugin

This is a javascript plugin that will place an image carousel into the DOM. 

Here is a demo of the plugin:

## Dependencies
You will need to include the JQuery library
Just add this script tag to your project:

`<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>`

## Usage
- To use this plugin you simply need the Javascript file. 
- Download the imageCarousel.js file and place it with your other JS files.
- include the script in your HTML: `<script type="text/javascript" src="imageCarousel.js"></script>`
- Place this div wherever you would like to place the image carousel: `<div class="plugin-carousel"></div>`
- The last step is to go to the JS file and replace the sample image URLS with the your own image URLS.

- You may also use the Reset CSS file to make the carousel full bleed.

*This system is subject to change based on how much more time I can work on this plugin. I would like to allow a more streamlined way to create the list of images, and refactor the JS into more OO functions.*
